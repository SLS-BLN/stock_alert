# 📈 Stock Alert

A Python application that monitors stock price changes and sends SMS alerts when thresholds are exceeded. This project was initially developed as part of a learning exercise and later refactored for better code quality and maintainability.

## 📜 Development History

- **Initial Development**: The core functionality was developed independently as part of a coding exercise.
- **Refactoring**: The code was later refactored with assistance from GitHub Copilot and Cascade to improve code quality, error handling, and maintainability.
- **Current State**: The application is now more robust, with better separation of concerns and error handling.

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches real-time stock data from Alpha Vantage API
- Evaluates percentage change against a configurable threshold
- Sends SMS alerts via Twilio
- Retrieves relevant news articles
- Simple configuration using `.env` file
- Clean, modular code structure
